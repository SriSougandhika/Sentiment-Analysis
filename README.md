# ðŸŒŸ Sentiment Analysis with Random Forest and SHAP Interpretability

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on social media text data using **Random Forest Classifier** after reducing the sentiment categories to just *Positive* and *Negative*. It includes interpretability with **SHAP**, misclassification analysis, and confusion matrix visualization.

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle:  
[Twitter Sentiment Dataset (Filtered for Positive/Negative)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/twitter-sentiment-analysis)

## ðŸ“Š Workflow Summary
1. Load and clean data
2. Filter sentiments with frequency â‰¥ 15
3. Reduce sentiment to *Positive* and *Negative*
4. Vectorize using **TF-IDF**
5. Train with **Random Forest**
6. Evaluate with accuracy, confusion matrix, and misclassified samples
7. Interpret model using **SHAP**

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- **Accuracy**: ~83%
- Misclassified examples shown for inspection
- Confusion matrix plotted
- SHAP values visualized for class-wise feature importance

## ðŸ§  Model Interpretability
SHAP helps visualize which words pushed the model toward Positive or Negative sentiments.
